## Sam and His Snacks Unlimited Online Store

Once upon a time there lived three silly children, Brady, Oakley, and Rylan who loved visiting their Mimi and Pop. They would play games, laugh, and enjoy their favorite snacks. Everyone was happy.

One day, the kids showed up at Mimi & Pop's house for a surprise visit. They excitedly ran into the room to get their favorite snacks only to find that all the snacks were gone!

Mimi & Pop were devastated to see their grandchildren in such a state of despair. It was a horrible scene that day and they never wanted this to happen again. They dreamed of a time when, no matter what, kids from all over the world WOULD GET THEIR FAVORITE SNACKS WHEN THEY WANTED THEM.

But what could they do? Suddenly, Pop remembered meeting Sam, the Snack Wizard, on one of his many adventures in the far away land of Canada. He knew Sam could save the day.

Pop still had Sam's phone number and called him. Sam was happy to hear from Pop again - he always liked Pop. He listened and wanted to help make this dream come true. 

"But I have a problem." said Sam. "To spread my magic around the world, I need to know WHAT snacks to magically appear and WHERE to magically send them. Oh, AND I need to collect a small fee to keep the magic alive."

"What if you had an online snack store where kids could make their snack wishes, send their location, and pay the fee digitally?", asked Pop.

"Yes! that would work! I could call it Snacks Unlimited. But I am no Software Wizard :-(", Sam said sadly.

"But I AM!", exclaimed Pop. So, Sam and Pop embarked on a journey to design and build Snacks Unlimited.
