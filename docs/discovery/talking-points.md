## Presentation Tips

* Do not walk around the room. Too much movement distracts the audience and it makes you look nervous.
* Stay by the podium. Keep one hand on the podium at all times.
* Always face the audience. Never turn your back to the audience.
* Keep your hands out of your pockets.

## Presentation Ideas

* Develop a short fairy tale story you read to the audience - using a book as a prop.

* Incorporate Snacks into your presentation.
- Show the happy ending of the kids getting their snacks.
- Bring in their favourite snacks to hand out to the audience
- A snickers bar to the first 3 audience members that send their commands to the Snacks Unlimited.
