## Raw Conversation

### USER: 
In Phase 2 of the Snickers Promotion App I want to setup API routes for each of the Card Components.

For each button onClick I want to show a spinner, disable the button, and make the API call. On success, the UI will go to the next screen. On error, the UI will display an error alert. After the API call the spinner will be hidden and the button set back to enabled.

### ASSISTANT: 
I'll help you implement API routes and button click handlers with loading states for your Snickers Promotion App. First, let's take a look at your current code structure to understand what we're working with.

I'll implement API routes and add loading states with error handling for each button in your Snickers Promotion App. Here's my plan:

1. Create API routes for each card interaction
2. Update the UI components with loading states and error handling
3. Implement the API calls from the front-end

Now I'll create the API route structure for your Next.js app and update the UI components with loading states and error handling. Let's start with creating the API routes.

I've successfully implemented the API routes and loading states for your Snickers Promotion App! Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Created API Routes:
   - `/api/promotion/route.ts`: Handles the "WISH I had a Snickers" button action
   - `/api/location/route.ts`: Handles the "HERE I am" button action
   - `/api/payment/route.ts`: Handles the "Complete WISH" button action

2. Updated UI Components with Loading States:
   - Added a reusable Spinner component to show during API calls
   - Added button disabling during API calls
   - Included "Processing..." text alongside the spinner for better UX
   - Implemented error handling with a dismissable error alert

3. Improved Application Flow:
   - Each button now triggers an API call with proper loading indicators
   - On success, the UI advances to the next screen
   - On error, an alert is displayed with the error message
   - Added error state management and cleanup functionality

The app now runs on http://localhost:3000 and you can interact with it to test the new features. The API routes simulate a 1-second delay to demonstrate the loading states.

The workflow is now:
1. User clicks a button
2. Button shows loading state and is disabled
3. API call is made
4. On success, the next screen is shown
5. On error, an error alert appears at the top right

You can dismiss any error messages by clicking the "Ã—" button on the alert.

USER: Can you add an input text field on the Location Screen below the location.png image? Use the placeholder text "Your Name (required)". If the value of the input is empty disable the button else enable the button

ASSISTANT: I'll add an input text field to the Location Screen and make the button conditionally enabled based on the input value. Let me update the page.tsx file.

I see there are some TypeScript errors in our implementation. I'll fix those and make sure everything works properly.

Now I'll also update the Location API route to process the userName data that will be sent from the frontend.

Now you can test the Snickers Promotion App with the new features:

1. The Location Screen has been updated with a required text input field for the user's name.
2. The "HERE I am" button is disabled until the user enters their name.
3. The input field has proper styling with focus states and a helpful placeholder.
4. When the button is clicked, the app now sends the user's name to the backend via the API call.
5. The backend validates the userName, ensuring it's provided and not empty.
6. The success message now includes the user's name.

These changes enhance the user experience by:
1. Enforcing required input before proceeding
2. Providing clear visual feedback about what's required
3. Sending user information to the backend for potential future processing
4. Validating data on both client and server sides

The app still maintains all the previous functionality with the loading spinner during API calls, button disabling, and error handling for failed API requests.

### USER: 
Can you refactor the screens into their own Typescript files?

### ASSISTANT: 
I'll refactor each screen component into its own TypeScript file to improve code organization. Here's my plan:

1. Create a components directory to house the screen components
2. Create individual files for each screen component
3. Update the main page.tsx file to import these components

The refactoring is now complete! I've organized your Snickers Promotion App into separate TypeScript components for better maintainability and code organization. 

Here's a summary of the changes I made:

#### 1. Created Component Structure
- Created a `components` directory with subdirectories for UI components and screens
- Separated common UI components (`Spinner` and `ErrorAlert`) into the `ui` directory
- Placed all screen components in the `screens` directory with proper TypeScript interfaces

#### 2. Component Breakdown
- `ui/Spinner.tsx`: Loading spinner component
- `ui/ErrorAlert.tsx`: Error alert component
- `screens/PromotionScreen.tsx`: First screen with "WISH I had a Snickers" button
- `screens/LocationScreen.tsx`: Second screen with name input and "HERE I am" button
- `screens/PaymentScreen.tsx`: Third screen with "Complete WISH" button
- `screens/WishSentScreen.tsx`: Final confirmation screen

#### 3. Main Page Updates
- Updated `page.tsx` to import all the separated components
- Kept all the state management and API call logic in the main component
- Made sure all props are passed correctly to each component

This refactoring offers several benefits:
1. Better maintainability: Each component lives in its own file
2. Improved readability: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
3. Type safety: Added TypeScript interfaces for component props
4. Reusability: Components can be reused elsewhere if needed
5. Easier testing: Individual components can be tested in isolation

The application should continue to function exactly as before, but with a cleaner codebase structure that will be easier to maintain and extend in the future.

### USER: 
Let's implement the promotion API.

I want to setup the API route handler to be setup as a server-side proxy.

From the Promotion Screen, I want the following request to be made as JSON:

{
    "orderId": "",
    
    "items": [
        {
            "itemId": "1",
            "itemName": "Snickers",
            "price": 0.01,
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}

In the proxy I want the request to be forwarded to the following URL: http://snack-order-commands:8800/api/item-details

### ASSISTANT: 
I'll implement the promotion API as a server-side proxy and update the Promotion screen to send the requested data. Let's start with updating the API route.

I've successfully implemented the promotion API as a server-side proxy and updated the client-side code to send the required JSON payload. Here's a summary of the changes:

#### 1. Updated the Promotion API Route
- Modified `/app/api/promotion/route.ts` to act as a server-side proxy
- Configured it to forward requests to `http://snack-order-commands:8800/api/item-details`
- Added proper error handling and logging
- The proxy will forward the exact JSON structure from the client and return the remote API's response

#### 2. Updated the Client-Side Code
- Modified the `handlePromotionNext` function in `page.tsx` to send the required JSON payload:
  ```json
  {
    "orderId": "",
    "items": [
      {
        "itemId": "1",
        "itemName": "Snickers",
        "price": 0.01,
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

The flow now works as follows:
1. User clicks the "WISH I had a Snickers" button
2. The client sends the specified JSON payload to your Next.js API route
3. The API route forwards this payload to the remote service
4. The remote response is returned to the client
5. On success, the app advances to the next screen

This implementation maintains all the existing loading states, error handling, and UI functionality while adding the required server-side proxy functionality.

### USER: 
For last change, how do I setup dev mode where a mock API call is made and for production mode the actual proxied call is made? 

### ASSISTANT: 
To set up different behavior for development and production environments in your Next.js application, I'll modify the promotion API route to conditionally use mock data or make the actual proxy call based on the environment. Here's how to implement it:

I've implemented a configuration-based approach that allows you to toggle between mock data and actual API calls. Here's what I've done:

#### 1. Created a Config Module

I've added a config module at `app/config/index.ts` that:
- Detects the environment (development vs production)
- Provides configuration for API endpoints
- Includes mock data for development testing

#### 2. Updated the Promotion API Route

The promotion API route now:
- Uses the configuration to determine whether to use mock data or make real API calls
- Includes proper timeout handling for API requests
- Provides detailed logging based on the environment

#### How to Control the Behavior

To switch between mock and real API calls, you have several options:

##### Option 1: Modify the Config File

You can directly edit the `app/config/index.ts` file to change the default behavior:

```typescript
// Change this line to force mock data or real API calls
export const apiConfig = {
  // ...
  useMockData: true, // Set to false to always use real API calls
  // ...
};
```

##### Option 2: Using Environment Variables

Since we can't create `.env` files directly, you can set environment variables when starting your development server:

```bash
# To use mock data in development
USE_MOCK_API=true npm run dev

# To use real API calls in development
USE_MOCK_API=false npm run dev
```

#### Option 3: Create a UI Toggle (Advanced)

For a more user-friendly approach, you could add a developer toggle in your UI:

1. Add a state in your app:
```typescript
const [useMockApi, setUseMockApi] = useState(true);
```

2. Pass this as part of your API requests:
```typescript
callApi('promotion', promotionData, { useMock: useMockApi });
```

3. Update your API route to check for this flag in the request

#### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Flexibility**: You can easily switch between mock and real API calls without code changes
2. **Better Development Experience**: Mock data provides predictable responses during development
3. **Production Safety**: Production always uses real API calls
4. **Better Error Handling**: Added timeout handling and detailed error information
5. **Configurability**: The API URL, timeout, and other settings can be changed in one place

#### Production Deployment

In production, the application will automatically use real API calls because `process.env.NODE_ENV` will be set to 'production'.

USER: Add the orderId in the API response to state to be used by the Location Screen and Payment Screen

ASSISTANT: I'll implement storing and using the orderId from the API response across screens. First, let's check the current state management in page.tsx.

Now I'll update the page.tsx file to store the orderId from the API response and pass it to the Location and Payment screens.

Now I'll update the Location API route to handle the orderId parameter.

Now I'll update the payment API to handle the orderId parameter.

I've successfully implemented the orderId tracking across all screens in your Snickers Promotion App. Now, when a user completes the promotion step, the orderId from the API response will be stored in state and passed to subsequent steps in the flow.

Here's a summary of the changes made:

#### 1. State Management Updates
- Added a new `orderId` state variable in the main `Home` component to track the order throughout the process
- Modified the `callApi` function to store the orderId when it's received from the promotion API
- Updated all API calls to pass the orderId to subsequent API endpoints

#### 2. API Route Updates

##### Promotion API
- The existing server-side proxy will now return an orderId that will be captured by the app

##### Location API
- Now receives the orderId from the client 
- Includes orderId in the response data
- Provides a fallback orderId if none is provided

##### Payment API
- Now receives and processes the orderId from the client
- Returns orderId along with payment details in the response
- Includes additional payment information (paymentId, amount, timestamp)

#### 3. Data Flow
The data flow is now:
1. User clicks "WISH I had a Snickers" â†’ API returns an orderId
2. App stores the orderId in state
3. Location screen sends userName + orderId
4. Payment screen sends the same orderId
5. Each step maintains the connection to the same order

This implementation maintains the existing 4-screen flow with card animations while adding proper state management for tracking the order throughout the process. The app continues to be fully responsive with proper loading states, error handling, and animation transitions.

### USER: 
Lets implement the API call for the Location Screen.

I want to setup the API route handler to be setup as a server-side proxy. 

From the Location Screen, I want the following request to be made as JSON using the orderId in State and the userName from the input field:

{
    "orderId": "${orderId}",
    "customerName": "${userName}",
    "customerAddress": "2115 Summit Ave.",
    "zipCode": "55105",
    "latitude": 44.9374829167,
    "longitude": -93.1893875758
}
In the proxy I want the request to be forwarded to the following URL: http://snack-order-commands:8800/api/shipping-location


Just like the item-details endpoint configure the API route for mocking

### ASSISTANT: 
I'll implement the Location API as a server-side proxy with mocking capability, similar to how we set up the Promotion API. Let's start by updating the config file to include the new endpoint.

Now I'll update the Location API route to function as a server-side proxy with mocking capabilities.

Now I'll update the handleLocationNext function in the main page.tsx file to ensure we're properly formatting the location data.

I've successfully implemented the Location API as a server-side proxy with mocking capability, similar to the Promotion API. Here's a summary of what I've done:

#### 1. Updated the Config File
Added the shipping-location endpoint and location mock data to `config/index.ts`:
- Added `shippingLocation: '/api/shipping-location'` to the endpoints config
- Created mock location data with all the required fields

#### 2. Implemented the Location API Server-Side Proxy
Modified `api/location/route.ts` to:
- Forward requests to `http://snack-order-commands:8800/api/shipping-location`
- Format the request data with all the required fields (customerName, customerAddress, zipCode, latitude, longitude)
- Support mocking in development mode
- Include timeout handling and detailed error information

#### 3. Updated the Main Component
Enhanced `page.tsx` to format the location data correctly:
- Updated `handleLocationNext` to format the data exactly as requested
- Included orderId from the state
- Added fixed values for address, zip code, and coordinates
- Properly used the userName from the input field

#### Data Flow
The location API request now follows this format:
```json
{
  "orderId": "orderId-from-state",
  "customerName": "userName-from-input",
  "customerAddress": "2115 Summit Ave.",
  "zipCode": "55105",
  "latitude": 44.9374829167,
  "longitude": -93.1893875758
}
```

Like the promotion API, the location API also includes:
- Automatic switching between mock data and real API calls based on environment
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Proper error handling and timeout management
- Fixed values for address, zip code, and coordinates

The app maintains the same responsive, animated 4-screen flow you specified in your requirements, now with robust API integration for the location screen.

### USER: 
Lets implement the API call for the Payment Screen.

I want to setup the API route handler to be setup as a server-side proxy. 

From the Payment Screen, I want the following request to be made as JSON using the orderId in State:

{
    "orderId": "${orderId}",
    "paymentType": "Credit Card",
    "creditCardType": "Magical Visa",
    "creditCardNumber": "7777-7777-7777-7777",
    "amount": 0.01
}

In the proxy I want the request to be forwarded to the following URL: http://snack-order-commands:8800/api/payment


Just like the item-details endpoint, configure the API route for mocking

### ASSISTANT: 
I'll implement the Payment API as a server-side proxy, similar to how we set up the Promotion and Location APIs. Let's start by updating the config file to include the new payment endpoint.

Now I'll implement the Payment API route to function as a server-side proxy.

Finally, I'll update the handlePaymentNext function in the main page.tsx file to properly format the payment data.

I've successfully implemented the Payment API as a server-side proxy with mocking capability, completing the set of API integrations for your Snickers Promotion App. Here's a summary of what I've done:

#### 1. Updated the Config File
Added the payment endpoint and payment mock data to `config/index.ts`:
- Added `payment: '/api/payment'` to the endpoints config
- Created mock payment data with all the required fields

#### 2. Implemented the Payment API Server-Side Proxy
Transformed `api/payment/route.ts` to:
- Forward requests to `http://snack-order-commands:8800/api/payment`
- Format the request data with all the required fields (paymentType, creditCardType, creditCardNumber, amount)
- Support mocking in development mode with detailed mock data
- Include timeout handling and comprehensive error information

#### 3. Updated the Main Component
Enhanced `page.tsx` to format the payment data correctly:
- Updated `handlePaymentNext` to format the data exactly as requested
- Included orderId from the state
- Added the required credit card and payment details

#### Payment Flow
The payment API request now follows this format:
```json
{
  "orderId": "orderId-from-state",
  "paymentType": "Credit Card",
  "creditCardType": "Magical Visa",
  "creditCardNumber": "7777-7777-7777-7777",
  "amount": 0.01
}
```

##3# Complete Integration
Your Snickers Promotion App now has a complete flow with API integrations for all screens:

1. **Promotion Screen**: Sends item details to `/api/item-details` endpoint
2. **Location Screen**: Sends shipping details to `/api/shipping-location` endpoint
3. **Payment Screen**: Sends payment info to `/api/payment` endpoint
4. **Wish Confirmation Screen**: Shows the final success message

Each API has:
- Development/production mode switching
- Mock data for testing
- Proper error handling and timeouts
- Loading states with spinners
- Button disabling during API calls
- Consistent order tracking across all screens

This implementation maintains the responsive, animated 4-screen flow specified in your requirements while adding robust API integration for each step of the user journey.
